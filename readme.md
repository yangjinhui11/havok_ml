
A Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis, combined with machine learning, is developed to predict chaotic time series. The HAVOK analysis based on delay embedding and Koopman theory can decompose chaotic dynamics into intermittently forced linear systems. A machine learning method is applied to estimate the external intermittently forcing term by using previous observed values of the time series. Finally, the combined method reconstructs a close linear model to simulate the dynamics of the time series.
